This project is my Web Dev 2 final for Code Kentucky. It is a user friendly information page for the popular video game Fortnite called Nite Info. (If it were a real site I imagine it as nite.info.) The site includes NAV based on one I created for my Web Dev 1 project. The site includes information about the history of Fortnite, a chart of the game's popularity over time utilizing chart.js, a character generator which displays a random character image picked from an array at the click of a button, and a YouTube search API which pulls results for related videos.

Set 1:
<br>
1. <b> Use arrays, objects, sets, or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.</b>
<br>
This requirement is met by the random character generator which utilizes an array to show a random photo upon a refresh or the click of a button. Please click multiple times to see different options.

2. <b>Visualize data in a user friendly way (e.g. graph, chart, etc.).</b>
<br>
For this requirement I built a chart using chart.js which displayed Fortnite's popularity over time. 

Set 2:
<br>
1. <b>Retrieve Data from a 3rd party API and use it to display something within your app.</b> 
<br>
For this requirement I implemented a YouTube search function which fetches results using the YouTube Search Results API.
